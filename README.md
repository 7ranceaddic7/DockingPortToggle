# DockingPortToggle

A mini-mod (modlet) for KSP that adds an on/off toggle to the stock docking ports to control their search functionality and increase performance on craft with many docking ports.  
  
Currently only supports the three stock unshielded docking ports; standard Clamp-O-Tron, Jr. and Sr. variants.  
  
This toggle effect is accomplished by adding an empty animation into the part hierarchy, and referencing this as the docking ports 'enable' animation -- effecting the same level of control over the docking ports functionality (and performance degredation) as is afforded by the two stock shielded docking ports.
